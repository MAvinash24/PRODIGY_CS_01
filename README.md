# PRODIGY_CS_01
## Caesar Cipher Tool

A simple yet interactive graphical user interface (GUI) application for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher technique. Built with Python and Tkinter, this tool is user-friendly and supports both encryption and decryption modes.

---

### Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Process text in either mode with a user-specified shift value.
- **Intuitive GUI**: A clear and responsive interface for better user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid inputs like non-integer shift values or empty text.
- **Result Display**: Displays the processed output in a dedicated text box.
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies, uses only Python's built-in libraries.

### How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of places in the alphabet. 
- In **encryption mode**, the text is shifted forward.
- In **decryption mode**, the text is shifted backward.
